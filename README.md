Create 27 commits on the Master branch (9 commits by each Team member) by developing single Python file. Develop main.py file with three simple methods: developer1method(), developer2method(), developer3method(). Every method is developed by single developer. Every method must print the following info: name, surname, email, cohort, age, gender, birthdate, speciality, country of origin. Hint: 9 commits = 9 print statements.

Create 3 branches (Feature1, Feature2, Feature3) that must be visible online and offline.

On each separate branch, each member must create 10 own commits. Commit messages must follow best practices to construct the messages. With team of three develop feature1.py, feature2.py, feature3.py files. Functionality of the file is up you. You can print 10 different statements or get 10 different inputs.

No merge is to be done in any branch.
